    <h2>CONTRIBUTION OF JINAN B</h2>

    <p>
    The transformation of Aruvakode from a fading pottery village into a thriving hub of contemporary design is 
    a story of deep immersion rather than simple consulting. When designer and activist Jinan B. arrived,
    he didn't approach the artisans with a clipboard and a lecture; instead, he moved into the village,
    living alongside the potters to truly grasp the weight of their economic and creative struggles.
    He recognized that while their technical mastery was flawless, their traditional product line had lost
    its footing in a modern world. To bridge this gap, Jinan initiated a process of "unlearning,
    " encouraging the artisans to step away from the constraints of the potter's wheel and rediscover the raw,
    creative potential of clay through hand-modelling and intricate relief work.
     This collaborative shift birthed the "Kumbham" collective, a structured guild that transformed 
     a scattered group of struggling families into a unified force capable of handling massive architectural commissions.
     By diversifying their craft into landscaping products, murals, and high-end home décor, Jinan helped the village pivot
     from basic utility to sophisticated artistry. This strategic intervention didn't just preserve a dying tradition;
     it restored the village’s economic pride. Today, the once-overlooked clay of Aruvakode has found a new life,
     gracing the walls of corporate offices and luxury resorts across India, proving that when tradition is met
     with empathetic design, it becomes timeless.
