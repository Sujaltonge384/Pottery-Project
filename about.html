    <h2 style="text-align: center; color: #643621 ;">Aruvakode Pottery Village: History and Decline of a Craft Tradition</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      Aruvacode, a small village in Malappuram, is a place where stories were once shaped in clay. For generations, nearly a hundred families of potters created everyday vessels—chulhas, urulis, and earthen pots—that formed the backbone of rural life. Pottery was not just a craft here; it was identity.<br><br>

      With the arrival of plastic, steel, and aluminium in the late 20th century, this tradition began to fade. Raw materials became scarce, demand declined, and younger generations moved away. By the early 1990s, Aruvacode stood on the brink of collapse.<br><br>

      The turning point came with the Kumbham Handicraft Project, led by designer and activist K. B. Jinan. The potters reimagined their craft, shifting from functional ware to architectural and decorative terracotta. Tiles, planters, and lifestyle products emerged—rooted in tradition, yet designed for contemporary spaces.<br><br>

      Today, Aruvacode’s terracotta is sought after by architects and designers, standing as a quiet testament to revival, resilience, and the timeless strength of clay.

    <h2>CONTRIBUTION OF K B JINAN </h2>

    <p>
    The transformation of Aruvakode from a fading pottery village into a thriving hub of contemporary design is 
    a story of deep immersion rather than simple consulting. When designer and activist Jinan B. arrived,
    he didn't approach the artisans with a clipboard and a lecture; instead, he moved into the village,
    living alongside the potters to truly grasp the weight of their economic and creative struggles.
    He recognized that while their technical mastery was flawless, their traditional product line had lost
    its footing in a modern world. To bridge this gap, Jinan initiated a process of "unlearning,
    " encouraging the artisans to step away from the constraints of the potter's wheel and rediscover the raw,
    creative potential of clay through hand-modelling and intricate relief work.
     This collaborative shift birthed the "Kumbham" collective, a structured guild that transformed 
     a scattered group of struggling families into a unified force capable of handling massive architectural commissions.
     By diversifying their craft into landscaping products, murals, and high-end home décor, Jinan helped the village pivot
     from basic utility to sophisticated artistry. This strategic intervention didn't just preserve a dying tradition;
     it restored the village’s economic pride. Today, the once-overlooked clay of Aruvakode has found a new life,
     gracing the walls of corporate offices and luxury resorts across India, proving that when tradition is met
     with empathetic design, it becomes timeless.
